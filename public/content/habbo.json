    "quote": "Habbo is an avatar-based game, and the profile photo project fits naturally into NFTs, we jumped at the idea and decided to put it into practice. [...] I spent tens of thousands of euros on mobile games like Hearthstone, but I didnâ€™t get anything when I finished the game, that money goes, so I believe in digital ownership.
